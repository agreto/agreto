<p>My name is Ava Greto and I am a sophomore at Elon University majoring in Strategic Communications with a minor in Professional Sales. I grew up in <a href="https://www.ryeny.gov/government/building-department">Rye, New York</a> , with my two parents, my older brother, Preston, my younger sister, Phoebe, and my two adorable dogs, Rocco and Storm. </p>

<P>This summer, I spent my time nannying for two little boys from morning to night, playing, swimming, and cooking each day. During my days off, I dog sat and walked for my neighbors. Being able to play with dogs was the best part of my days! </P>

<P>My hobbies this summer included playing basketball, tennis, and hanging out with my family and friends. In my free time I also like to spend my time listening to music, my favorite song is Enchanted by Taylor Swift. I also spent a lot of my summer traveling with friends and family. My favorite destination this summer was Italy. Being with my parents, siblings, cousins, and grandparents were special.</P>
